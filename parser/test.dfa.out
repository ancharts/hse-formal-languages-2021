edges list:
from vertex 0S with type START to vertex 1M with type MIDDLE if symbols are B
from vertex 1M with type MIDDLE to vertex 0S with type START if symbols are A
from vertex 1M with type MIDDLE to vertex 1T with type TERMINAL if symbols are B
from vertex 1T with type TERMINAL to vertex 1M with type MIDDLE if symbols are B
from vertex 1T with type TERMINAL to vertex 2M with type MIDDLE if symbols are A
from vertex 2M with type MIDDLE to vertex 1T with type TERMINAL if symbols are B
from vertex 2M with type MIDDLE to vertex 0S with type START if symbols are A
from vertex 0S with type START to vertex 2M with type MIDDLE if symbols are A
